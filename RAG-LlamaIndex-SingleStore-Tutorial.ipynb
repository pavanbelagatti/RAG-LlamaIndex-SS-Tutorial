What are the main economic challenges discussed in the report?\nResponse: The main economic challenges discussed in the report include tight labor markets in developed economies, the world being off track to eliminate extreme poverty, global trade facing significant challenges, volatile commodity markets, risks of overtightening monetary policies, revisiting inflation targets, the need for effective coordination between monetary and fiscal policies, better international partnerships for responding to ongoing shocks, economic crisis and output gaps, output losses from the pandemic, weak employment recovery, higher risks to food security, rising debt vulnerabilities in developing countries, and the lingering effects of the pandemic.\n\nQuery: What are the key recommendations for policy makers?\nResponse: Policy makers are advised to strike a balance between emergency spending to protect vulnerable populations and development spending to enhance economic productivity. They should prioritize public investments in areas with significant multiplier effects, such as sustainable infrastructure and green technologies, to stimulate short-term output and long-term growth potential. Additionally, policy makers should focus on domestic resource mobilization by improving tax administration, broadening the tax base, and shifting towards direct and progressive taxes. It is recommended to reprioritize expenditures, target public investments effectively, and enhance investment coordination between the public and private sectors to foster economic growth and recovery.\n\nQuery: What about the Microchip supply?\nResponse: Microchip supply shortages have been prevalent in recent years due to increased demand for electronic goods during the pandemic and disruptions in the supply chain. While short-term shortages have eased somewhat, long-term challenges persist as demand for microchips continues to grow. Structural weaknesses in the supply chain, such as geographical concentration and vulnerabilities to geopolitical tensions, also contribute to the ongoing challenges in microchip supply. Efforts are being made globally to invest in research and development, manufacturing, and human resources to address these issues and enhance resilience in the microchip supply chain.\n\nQuery: The microchip supply shortage is predicted to rise or fall down?\nResponse: The microchip supply shortage is predicted to rise above $200 billion in market value.\n\nQuery: What is Ireland's GDP growth shown in the report?\nResponse: Ireland's GDP growth shown in the report is 5.1% in 2021.\n\nQuery: How much is the clean energy investment?\nResponse: The clean energy investment is projected to require about $1 trillion per year by 2030.\n\nQuery: What was the job loss that happened in the United States that is stated in the report?\nResponse: Job losses in the United States peaked at 22 million during the pandemic, as mentioned in the report.\n"}],"source":"if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Example queries\n    queries = [\n        \"What are the main economic challenges discussed in the report?\",\n        \"What are the key recommendations for policy makers?\",\n        \"What about the Microchip supply?\",\n        \"The microchip supply shortage is predicted to rise or fall down?\",\n        \"What is Ireland's GDP growth shown in the report?\",\n        \"How much is the clean energy investment?\",\n        \"What was the job loss that happened in the United States that is stated in the report?\",\n    ]\n    \n    for query in queries:\n        print(f\"\\nQuery: {query}\")\n        response = query_document(query)\n        print(f\"Response: {response}\")"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"eb93a06b-8808-4237-bdfb-01e84d2f84b3","metadata":{"language":"python","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"jupyterlab":{"notebooks":{"version_major":6,"version_minor":4}},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.9"},"singlestore_cell_default_language":"python","singlestore_connection":{"connectionID":"","defaultDatabase":""},"singlestore_row_limit":300},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
